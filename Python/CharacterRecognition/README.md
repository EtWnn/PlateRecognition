# CharacterRecognition
Handwritten alhpanumeric character recognition using keras (tensorflow 2).

### Data sets

For this project, we will use two datasets.
The first one is the famous MNIST (digits only), the second one is from this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format) (letters only).


### Model

The CNN model is trained in the 'Model_training.ipynb' notebook. There is a saved model in the folder 'Models' that achieved 98.3% test accuracy.
